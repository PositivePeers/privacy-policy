The additional rights and protections set forth in this section of this Policy apply only to residents of the European Union or the EEA</p>

            <h2>GDPR DEFINITIONS</h2>
            <h4>THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THIS SECTION OF THE PRIVACY POLICY:</h4>
            <b>“Processor”</b>means any Person Processing Personal Information.<br>
            <b>“Person”</b> means a natural person, corporation, association, organization, partnership, or other legal entity.<br>
            <b>“Processing”</b> is any activity that involves use of the Personal Information.

In accordance with the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Information, as set out above, the legal basis for processing your Personal Information will typically be one of the following:</p>

                <li>
                    our own legitimate business interests, or the legitimate business interests of our third party partners, promoters, affiliates, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors, such as, for example, providing direct marketing to our customers of our products and services that we think would be of interest, permitting prospective employees to search and apply for job opportunities, handling inquiries from our promoters, affiliates, distributors, vendors, and customers, or other instances where we have carried out a legitimate interests assessment and have established an existing legitimate interest;
                </li>

            <h2>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
            
            <p>The data that we collect from you is stored on our servers or on servers provided by cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. If you are a resident of the EEA, your Personal Information may be transferred within or outside the EEA to areas where privacy laws may be less strict than in the EEA (for such transfers of your Personal Information to our systems in the United States, we comply with the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth herein). By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to this transfer, storing, and processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

            <p>In some cases, there is a legal requirement to keep Personal Information for a minimum period of time. Except in those circumstances, we do not keep your Personal Information for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected or for which it is to be further processed.</p>


            <h2> YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>Subject to certain exceptions, you have the following rights with respect to your Personal Information:</p>
            <ul>

                    To receive or access a copy of the Personal Information that we hold about you;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To request that any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information be corrected or supplemented;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To have your Personal Information erased, unless we have a legitimate reason to retain the Personal Information (such as if we are required to do so for legal reasons); and
                </li>
                <li>
                    To ask us not to process your Personal Information for a particular purpose, including for marketing
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these rights are subject to certain conditions and exemptions. For example, IH will not be obligated to erase your Personal Information if we need to retain it to protect ourselves in the event of a legal claim.<br><br>
